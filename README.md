## ðŸ‘‹ Mostafa M. Moaaz
### Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Computer Science graduate (Class of 2020) with over 5 years experience on python, strong interest in Cloud DevOps, Linux System Administration, and Automation. Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems with technology and constantly building tools, scripts, and infrastructure to make systems more efficient.

#### ðŸš€ Projects
Explore the repositories I've created â€” from automation scripts to infrastructure setups and cloud-native applications. I try to keep things tidy and documented.

I usually update my repositories once or twice a month, so thereâ€™s always something new coming up.

Feel free to browse around and make yourself at home.
